# Updates and Errata - Seventh printing

This page is broken into two parts, Updates and Errata. *Updates* address issues that affect whether your code will run or not. *Errata* refer to minor issues such as typos, and errors in grayed-out code that probably won’t affect the code you’re entering.

Code that produces warnings but still runs correctly is noted under Errata, as this is a fairly common occurrence and the code often still works for a long time while producing warnings.

If you find an error in the book that's not listed here, or can’t get something to work, please [let me know](../contact.md).

### Chapter 20

The second half of Chapter 20, starting on page 445, focuses on the process of deploying Learning Log to the hosting company Platform.sh. That company has rebranded as Upsun, and they've changed their approach to deployment somewhat.

Fully up-to-date instructions for deploying Learning Log are posted on the [Deploying Django](deploying_django.md) page. If anything in these instructions is not working for you, please don't hesitate to [reach out](../contact.md).

### Chapter 10

The exercise *Cats and Dogs* (10-8) on page 200 should refer to "the `FileNotFoundError`", instead of "the `FileNotFound` error".
