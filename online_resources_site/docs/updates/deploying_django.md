# Deploying Django

Building a Django project that works on your system is satisfying, but it gets even more satisfying when you see your site deployed where anyone can access it.

Platform.sh is now Upsun
---

In the second half of Chapter 20, the book walks you through the process of deploying to the hosting company Platform.sh. That company has rebranded as Upsun, and they've changed their approach to deployment somewhat. The printed instructions no longer work for deployment, but the instructions here are fully up to date. If you run into any steps that don't seem to work, please [reach out](../contact.md) and I will update these instructions. Thank you!
