When the username doesn't exist, or the username is incorrect, the <code>return</code> statement is never reached. The second part of the function will only run when the <code>if</code> statements fail, so we don't need an <code>else</code> block. Now the function prompts for a new username when either <code>if</code> statement fails.</p> <p>The only thing left to address is the nested <code>if</code> statements. This can be cleaned up by moving the code that checks whether the username is correct to a separate function. If you're enjoying this exercise, you might try making a new function called <code>check_username()</code> and see if you can remove the nested <code>if</code> statement from <code>greet_user()</code>.</p>"},{"location":"solutions/chapter_11/","title":"Solutions - Chapter 11","text":""},{"location":"solutions/chapter_11/#11-1-city-country","title":"11-1: City, Country","text":"<p>Write a function that accepts two parameters: a city name and a country name.

Write a program called test_python_repos.py that uses <code>pytest</code> to assert that the value of <code>status_code</code> is 200. Figure out some other assertions you can make: for example, that the number of items returned is expected and that the total number of repositories is greater than a certain amount.</p> <p>Note: It's much easier to test a program that's broken up into functions or classes.

Try a simple change, such as writing more about the project on the home page. Then try adding a more advanced feature, such as giving users the option of making a topic public.
