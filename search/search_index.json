Try a simple change, such as writing more about the project on the home page. Then try adding a more advanced feature, such as giving users the option of making a topic public. This would require an attribute called <code>public</code> as part of the <code>Topic</code> model (this should be set to <code>False</code> by default) and a form element on the new_topic page that allows the user to change a topic from private to public. You\u2019d then need to migrate the project and revise views.py so any topic that\u2019s public is visible to unauthenticated users as well.</p> <p>Giving users the option to make some of their topics public is a fairly involved task, if Learning Log is your first experience with Django. It may be helpful to look at some specific parts of the documentation, if you're trying to implement this feature:</p> <ul> <li>The Model Field Reference tells you all about the different kinds of fields you can use in a models.py file, and the settings you can use for those fields.<ul> <li>Using default values for a field</li> <li>BooleanField</li> </ul> </li> <li>Making queries shows you how to write more complex queries, such as filtering for public topics that are not associated with the current user.<ul> <li>Filters</li> <li>Chaining filters</li> </ul> </li> <li>When you want to present different information for anonymous and authenticated users, it's helpful to look at the django.contrib.auth documentation.<ul> <li>The is_authenticated attribute, which can be used to find out if a user has authenticated (logged in) or not.</li> <li>See also Limiting access to logged-in users</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Here are a few parts of some specific files to note. First, add a new <code>public</code> attribute to the <code>Topic</code> model:</p> models.py<pre><code>class Topic(models.Model):\n\"\"\"A topic the user is learning about.\"\"\"\ntext = models.CharField(max_length=200)\ndate_added = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)\npublic = models.BooleanField(default=False)\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>public</code> field needs to be included in <code>TopicForm</code>:</p> forms.py<pre><code>class TopicForm(forms.ModelForm):\nclass Meta:\nmodel = Topic\nfields = ['text', 'public']\n...\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>topics</code> and <code>topic</code> views should no longer be protected by <code>@login_required</code>. Also, we make two separate queries, depending on whether the user is authenticated or not. For an authenticated user we get their topics, and a separate list of public topics from other users. For unauthenticated users, we just get all public topics. In the topic view, we set <code>is_owner</code>, so we know whether to show the links to add new entries, or edit existing entries. We also update the conditions for returning a 404 page:</p> views.py<pre><code>def topics(request):\n\"\"\"Show all of the current user's topics, and public topics that belong\n    to other users.\n    \"\"\"\n# Get all appropriate topics.\n# If a user is logged in, we get all of their topics, and all public topics\n#   from other users.\n# If a user is not logged in, we get all public topics.\nif request.user.is_authenticated:\ntopics = Topic.objects.filter(owner=request.user).order_by('date_added')\n# Get all public topics not owned by the current user.\n# Note: Wrapping the query in parentheses lets you break the long query\n#   up across multiple lines.\npublic_topics = (Topic.objects\n.filter(public=True)\n.exclude(owner=request.user)\n.order_by('date_added'))\nelse:\n# User is not authenticated; return all public topics.\ntopics = None\npublic_topics = Topic.objects.filter(public=True).order_by('date_added')\ncontext = {'topics': topics, 'public_topics': public_topics}\nreturn render(request, 'learning_logs/topics.html', context)\ndef topic(request, topic_id):\n\"\"\"Show a single topic and all its entries.\"\"\"\ntopic = Topic.objects.get(id=topic_id)\n# We only want to show new_entry and edit_entry links if the current\n#   user owns this topic.\nis_owner = False\nif request.user == topic.owner:\nis_owner = True\n# If the topic belongs to someone else, and it is not public,\n#   show an error page.\nif (topic.owner != request.user) and (not topic.public):\nraise Http404\nentries = topic.entry_set.order_by('-date_added')\ncontext = {'topic': topic, 'entries': entries, 'is_owner': is_owner}\nreturn render(request, 'learning_logs/topic.html', context)\n</code></pre> <p>On the topics page, we show two unordered lists.
